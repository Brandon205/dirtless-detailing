          <li>
            Besides PPF it is the best protection for your paint, ceramic coatings increase the hardness of your paint, making it less likely to scratch while
            washing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Coatings increase the Gloss and Slickness of your paint, which can help remove dirt before it gets trapped under your wash mitts leading to
            scratches.
          </li>
          <li>
            Self cleaning properties: ceramic coatings easily bead water, dirt gets caught in these beads and will fly off while you're driving! Your windshield
            will bead water like never before as well!
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be far easier to wash and dry your car. Dirt will wash off with less effort, you can also blow dry 90% of your vehicle when you're done
            washing.

        Unlike waxes true ceramic coatings don't just wash off, however, over time your coating can get clogged with contaminants and gloss, slickness, and
        water beading can degrade (for this coating it should stay in good quality for up to 3 years). If you want to maintain all the benefits of your ceramic
        coating we recommend getting at least our{" "}

        We never recommend going through a car wash as they can reduce the gloss slickness and beading of your coating prematurely. However in a pinch a
