He was confident he could remove most all the scratches and make it look good again. He definitely did! It looks great. Very impressed with his knowledge, skill and customer service. I highly recommend Brenden and Dirt-Less Detailing."

I can tell he takes pride in what he does with the level of detail displayed. Great customer service and reasonably priced. Highly recommend!!"

They shampooed the seat and completely got rid of the smell. The service was incredibly professional, and the staff was friendly and helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with the results. I would highly recommend them to anyone in need of car detailing services. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!"
